# Vanilla JS SPA Application

Welcome to the Vanilla JS SPA Application! This is a Single Page Application built using vanilla JavaScript, featuring a modular code structure with classes that extend `HTMLElement`.

## Overview

This application provides a simple example of a Single Page Application (SPA) created with vanilla JavaScript. It showcases a modular architecture where components are defined as classes extending `HTMLElement`. The components are then connected to the DOM using the `connectedCallback` method.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, you'll need to start an HTTP server. Here's how you can do it using Python:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Start an HTTP server using Python 3:
   ```sh
   python3 -m http.server
